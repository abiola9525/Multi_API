                        # Multi-API with Django Rest Framework

This project is a multi-purpose API built with Django Rest Framework that provides various endpoints for different types of data, including:

1. Countries details: Information about countries, including their capitals, populations, GDPs, currencies, and more.

                        ## Requirements
  i. Python 3.x
  
  ii. Django 3.x
  
  iii. Django Rest Framework 3.x

                         ## Usage
Each API endpoint has its own set of views and serializers. The urls.py file in each app maps the URLs to the corresponding views.

To use the APIs, you can make HTTP requests to the respective endpoints using a client, such as curl or Postman.
